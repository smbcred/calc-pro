=== HEADER OPTIMIZATION ===
Current: "Your Federal R&D Tax Credit Analysis"
Better: "Complete Your R&D Tax Credit Order"
Or: "Finalize Your Filing Package"

Add progress indicator: "Final Step • Secure Checkout"

=== HERO NUMBERS REFINEMENT ===
Love the big numbers display! Consider:
- Add labels under numbers: "Your Credit" | "Your Investment"
- Or make relationship clearer: "Get $28,500 for just $750"
- Add ROI badge: "37x return on investment"

=== DEADLINE MESSAGING ===
Current warning is good but could be stronger:
"⏰ July 2026 Amendment Deadline
You have until July 2026 to claim 2022-2024 credits. After that, these credits expire forever. Most businesses miss out on $75,000+ by waiting too long."

=== YEAR SELECTION ENHANCEMENT ===
The checkboxes are good but add:
- Show estimated credit for each year (not just price)
- "2024 (Lookback): ~$26,000 credit for +$297"
- "2023 (Lookback): ~$24,000 credit for +$297"
- Running total: "Total Credits: $78,500 for $1,344"

=== PRICING SUMMARY IMPROVEMENT ===
Add value comparison:
Base (2025): $750 → Gets you $28,500
Additional Years (2): $594 → Gets you $50,000
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Investment: $1,344 → Total Credits: $78,500
