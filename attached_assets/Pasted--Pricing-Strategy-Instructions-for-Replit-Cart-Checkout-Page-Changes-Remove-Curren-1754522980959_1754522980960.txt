## **Pricing Strategy Instructions for Replit**

### **Cart/Checkout Page Changes**

**Remove Current Package Structure:**
- Remove "Essential Package" ($397)
- Remove "Professional Package" ($797)  
- Remove "Enterprise Package" ($1,597)
- Remove package comparison features
- Remove "Best for credits up to $X" messaging

**Implement Our Actual Pricing Model:**

### **New Cart Page Structure**

**1. Display Calculated Base Price**
```
Your Federal R&D Tax Credit Analysis

Calculated Credit: $33,700
Your Price: $750
(Price based on your credit amount of $33,700)
```

**2. Add Year Selection Section**
Move the year selection from Step 4 to cart:
```
📅 Select Tax Years to File

☑ 2025 (Current Year): Included
□ 2024 (Lookback): +$297
□ 2023 (Lookback): +$297
□ 2022 (Lookback): +$297

Why add previous years?
• Most businesses using ChatGPT and AI tools qualify for 2+ years
• Same documentation effort covers all years
• Credits expire after 3 years - don't miss out
• Multi-year discount already applied
```

**3. Dynamic Pricing Display**
```
Pricing Summary:
Base (2025): $750
Additional Years: $[calculated based on selections]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total: $[calculated total]
```

### **Step 4 (Results Page) Changes**

**Add messaging about additional years (but don't show year selection):**
- "You can claim credits for up to 3 previous years"
- "Additional years available at checkout for just $297 each"
- "Most businesses have been using AI/automation for 2+ years"

**Keep it simple:**
- Show calculated credit amount
- Show base price
- "Proceed to Checkout" button

### **Pricing Logic to Implement**

**Base Price Calculation:**
- If credit < $10,000 → $500
- If credit $10,000-$50,000 → $750
- If credit $50,000-$100,000 → $1,000
- If credit > $100,000 → $1,500

**Additional Years:**
- Always $297 per year
- Maximum 3 additional years (2024, 2023, 2022)

### **Remove These Elements**
- Package tiers/comparisons
- "Save 20%" annual toggle
- Monthly pricing options
- "Most Popular" badges
- "Recommended" tags
- Fixed price packages

This creates a personalized pricing experience based on their actual calculated credit rather than forcing them into predefined packages.
