🎯 Project Context:
I'm building an R&D tax credit app in Replit. The `/checkout` page has a fully designed UI that shows:

- Estimated credit value (e.g., $28,500)
- Tier-based base package price (e.g., $750 for Tier 2)
- Multiple checkboxes to let users select tax years to file (2025, 2024, 2023, etc.)
- Each year costs $297 — including 2025
- A single CTA button: “Complete My Order – $750” (this amount must update based on selection)

---

🧩 What I Need You to Build:

1. A backend API route (e.g., `/api/stripeCheckout`) that:
   - Accepts `POST` JSON:
     ```ts
     {
       email: string,
       tierBasePrice: number, // e.g. 750
       yearsSelected: number[] // e.g. [2025, 2024]
     }
     ```
   - Constructs Stripe Checkout `line_items` using:
     - 1 item: “R&D Credit Filing Package (Tier)” → `$tierBasePrice`
     - 1 item per selected year (e.g. “Tax Year 2025 Filing”) → `$297 each`

2. The Stripe Checkout session:
   - Should be created in **Test Mode**
   - Returns the session URL to redirect the user
   - No need to handle success/cancel pages yet — just create and redirect

3. On the frontend:
   - Update the checkout page button so that:
     - It reads which years were selected (checkboxes)
     - It calculates total price: `tierBasePrice + $297 * years.length`
     - Sends a `POST` to `/api/stripeCheckout` with email, base price, and selected years
     - Redirects user to Stripe Checkout URL

💬 Example Frontend Button Logic:
```ts
const handleCheckout = async () => {
  const email = document.querySelector('#email').value;
  const years = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input[name="year"]:checked')).map(y => parseInt(y.value));
  const basePrice = 750; // This would be dynamic based on credit size

  const res = await fetch('/api/stripeCheckout', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, tierBasePrice: basePrice, yearsSelected: years })
  });

  const data = await res.json();
  window.location.href = data.url;
};
