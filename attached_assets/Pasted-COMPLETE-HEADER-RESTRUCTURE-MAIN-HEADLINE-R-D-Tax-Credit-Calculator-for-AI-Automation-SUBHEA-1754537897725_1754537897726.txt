VISUAL DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS:

TYPOGRAPHY:

- No multiple colors in headline
- Calculator = your brand accent color (teal/green)
- Clean, trustworthy font (Inter, Helvetica)

HEADER BACKGROUND:
- Pure white or very light gray (#fafafa)
- No gradients or patterns
- Clean borders between sections

PROFESSIONAL TOUCHES:
- Add subtle "BETA" or "2024 Tax Year" badge
- Small "How it works" link in top right
- "Methodology" link for credibility

MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
- Stack trust elements vertically
- Reduce headline to: "AI R&D Tax Credit Calculator"
- Keep cards but make scrollable horizontally

ALTERNATIVE HEADLINES TO TEST:

Option A (Tool-focused):
"AI R&D Tax Credit Calculator"
"Find out how much your business can claim"

Option B (Benefit-focused):
"Calculate Your R&D Tax Credits"
"For businesses using AI and automation"

Option C (Authority-focused):
"Federal R&D Tax Credit Calculator"
"IRS Section 41 credits for AI innovation"

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- "$500,000" claim (unrealistic for target market)
- "Get Money Back" language (too salesy)
- Multiple colors in headline (unprofessional)
- "Up to" language (sounds like fine print)

FINAL RECOMMENDED HEADER:

Main: "R&D Tax Credit Calculator"
Sub: "Calculate federal tax credits for AI and automation expenses"
Trust bar: "IRS Section 41 Compliant ‚Ä¢ Secure Calculation ‚Ä¢ 2-Minute Results"

This positions SMBTaxCredits.com as a professional financial tool rather than a "get rich quick" scheme, building immediate trust and credibility.
