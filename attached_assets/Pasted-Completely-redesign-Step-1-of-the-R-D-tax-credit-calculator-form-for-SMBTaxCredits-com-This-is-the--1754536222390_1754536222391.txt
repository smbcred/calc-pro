Completely redesign Step 1 of the R&D tax credit calculator form for SMBTaxCredits.com. This is the assessment form that appears AFTER the landing page.

=== CONTEXT ===
- Users have already been educated by the landing page
- They clicked to start their assessment
- This is Step 1 of 4 steps
- Goal: Collect basic info to show calculations in Step 2
- Remove ALL educational content - this is pure data collection

=== PAGE LAYOUT ===

Create a clean, centered form with maximum width suitable for easy reading. Use plenty of white space and no decorative elements.

HEADER SECTION:
- Show a progress bar indicating Step 1 of 4 (25% complete)
- Add "Step 1 of 4" on the left and "About 2 minutes" on the right
- Main heading: "Let's Check Your R&D Qualification"
- Subheading: "Tell us about your business technology use"
- Use professional, clear typography throughout

=== QUALIFICATION CHECKBOXES ===

Create a section with light gray background and subtle border:

SECTION TITLE:
- Add a green checkmark icon
- Text: "Which of these apply to your business?"
- Helper text: "Select all that apply - even partial use qualifies"

CHECKBOXES:
Keep all 6 existing checkboxes with their current text and colored tags. Make each checkbox row tall enough for easy clicking on mobile. When hovered, show a light blue background. When checked, show blue background.

DYNAMIC ENCOURAGEMENT:
Below the checkboxes, show an encouraging message based on how many they select:
- 1-2 selections: "Good start! Based on these activities, you likely qualify."
- 3-4 selections: "Excellent! You have significant R&D activities."
- 5-6 selections: "Outstanding! You have substantial qualifying work."

Show this in a blue-tinted box with a lightbulb icon. Animate it in smoothly when checkboxes are selected.

=== BUSINESS INFORMATION ===

Below the checkboxes, create a clean form section:

LAYOUT:
Arrange fields in a 2x2 grid on desktop, single column on mobile.

COMPANY NAME FIELD:
- Label: "Company Name"
- Add a small lock icon inside the field on the right
- Placeholder text: "Your Company, Inc."
- Make the field tall and easy to click

INDUSTRY DROPDOWN:
- Label: "Industry"
- Create a dropdown menu with these options:
  * Technology & Software
  * E-commerce & Retail
  * Professional Services
  * Marketing & Creative
  * Healthcare & Medical
  * Manufacturing
  * Financial Services
  * Other
- Add small icons next to each option if possible

TAX YEAR SELECTOR:
- Label: "Tax Year to Calculate"
- Show as 4 buttons in a row: 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022
- Pre-select 2024
- Selected button should be blue with white text and a checkmark
- Unselected buttons should be white with gray border
- Below buttons add: "Additional years can be added for $297 each"

ANNUAL REVENUE:
- Label: "Annual Revenue"
- Show as two clickable cards side by side:
  
  First card:
  * Rocket emoji at top
  * "Under $5M Revenue"
  * "Qualify for cash refunds"
  
  Second card:
  * Building emoji at top
  * "LLC & S-Corp Benefits"
  * "Pass-through tax advantages"

Make cards equal height with borders. Selected card gets blue border and light blue background.

=== FOOTER SECTION ===

Center all footer content:

CONTINUE BUTTON:
- Text: "Continue to Calculation" with arrow
- Make it large and blue with white text
- Should be obviously clickable
- On mobile, make it full width

BELOW BUTTON:
- Add reassuring text: "Free calculation • No payment required • Takes 2 minutes"
- Use bullet points between phrases

TRUST INDICATORS:
- At the very bottom in small gray text:
- "SSL Secured   GDPR Compliant   IRS Approved"
- Add small icons if possible

=== MOBILE ADJUSTMENTS ===

On phones:
- Stack all fields vertically
- Make buttons and fields full width
- Ensure everything is easily tappable
- Consider making the Continue button stick to bottom of screen
- Stack the year buttons in a 2x2 grid if needed

=== USER EXPERIENCE ===

VALIDATION:
- Require at least one checkbox and all fields before continuing
- Show friendly error messages below fields if needed
- Add green checkmarks when fields are completed correctly
- Don't validate while user is typing, wait until they move to next field

SAVING PROGRESS:
- Automatically save their entries as they go
- If they return, pre-fill what they already entered
- Don't make them start over

FEEDBACK:
- When they click Continue, show "Analyzing..." with a spinner
- Disable the form while processing
- Make all interactions feel smooth and professional

=== TONE AND STYLE ===

- Professional but friendly
- Clean and uncluttered
- Similar to TurboTax or other financial tools
- No marketing language or sales pitches
- Focus entirely on collecting their information efficiently
- Build trust through good design, not trust badges everywhere

=== REMOVE THESE ELEMENTS ===

- All educational content about R&D credits
- Statistics and percentages
- Explanations of why credits matter
- Links to learn more
- Multiple buttons or CTAs
- Decorative graphics or patterns
- Gradient backgrounds
- Marketing testimonials
- Price mentions before they see their calculation

The final result should feel like a professional financial assessment tool that respects the user's time and makes it easy to provide their information.
