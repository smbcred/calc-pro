Create a high-converting R&D tax credit calculator landing page that masterfully balances education, trust, and urgency. This should feel like "TurboTax meets Product Hunt" - professional enough for financial data but modern and exciting enough to convert skeptical SMB owners.

=== STRATEGIC APPROACH ===
Users don't know they qualify for this credit. We must:
1. Educate them that it exists and they qualify
2. Build trust for financial information
3. Create urgency without being scammy
4. Convert them to our paid service
