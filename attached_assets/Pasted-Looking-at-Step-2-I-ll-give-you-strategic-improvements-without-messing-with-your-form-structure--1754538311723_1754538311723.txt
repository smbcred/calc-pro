Looking at Step 2, I'll give you strategic improvements without messing with your form structure:

## **Step 2 Content & Flow Optimization**

### **1. REMOVE THE 4-STEP FLOW DIAGRAM**
Just like Step 1, replace with:
- Simple text: "Step 2 of 4 • Enter Your Expenses • 3 minutes"
- Or slim progress bar showing 50% complete

### **2. REFRAME THE HEADER SECTION**

**Current:** "Your AI & Technology Expenses for 2024"
**Better:** "Calculate Your 2024 R&D Tax Credit"

The statistics (90%, 65%, 100%) are good but need context:
- Add labels: "of ChatGPT costs qualify" / "of contractor costs qualify" / "of automation costs qualify"
- Or move these to helper text near relevant fields

### **3. IMPROVE "WHAT COUNTS" SECTION**

This educational content is valuable but poorly placed. Options:
1. Move to collapsible "Learn More" sections by each input
2. Convert to tooltips (?) next to each field
3. Move entire section below the form inputs

Current placement interrupts the flow from header to inputs.

### **4. SIMPLIFY FIELD LABELS & HELPERS**

**Employee Wages Section:**
- Current: "Total Employee Wages"
- Better: "Employee Costs (Including Yourself)"
- Helper text: "Salaries for anyone working on AI, automation, or tech improvements"
- Add: "Not sure? Use our estimator" link

**Contractor Section:**
- Current: "Total Contractor/Freelancer Costs"  
- Better: "Contractor & Consultant Costs"
- Helper text: "Developers, AI consultants, automation specialists, etc."

### **5. ENHANCE THE INPUT FIELDS**

For dollar amount fields:
- Add automatic formatting ($XX,XXX)
- Include placeholder text: "$0" or "Enter amount"
- Show running total in corner: "Qualifying expenses so far: $XX,XXX"

For the supplies fields:
- Add common examples as placeholder text
- "e.g., $200/mo for ChatGPT Plus"

### **6. FIX THE "PREVIOUS R&D CREDIT" PLACEMENT**

This checkbox seems random. Either:
- Move to Step 1 as a qualifier
- Move to end of Step 2
- Remove entirely (not needed for calculation)

### **7. ADD SMART HELPERS**

Next to each input section, add small links:
- "Typical amounts for your industry"
- "What qualifies?"
- "Include partial amounts"

### **8. IMPROVE THE CTA**

Current: "Calculate My Credits →"
Better: "See My Credit Amount →"

Add below: "Calculation based on IRS Section 41 methodology"

### **9. ADD PROGRESS INDICATORS**

As users fill fields, show:
- Green checkmarks when sections complete
- Running qualification: "Qualifying expenses: $XX,XXX"
- Estimated credit preview: "Estimated credit: ~$X,XXX"

### **10. TRUST WITHOUT OVERWHELMING**

Remove duplicate disclaimers. Keep one simple line:
"Your financial data is encrypted and never stored"

### **QUICK WINS:**

1. **Move educational content below form or into tooltips**
2. **Add $ formatting to all currency fields**
3. **Show running total of qualifying expenses**
4. **Clearer labels: "Employee Costs (Including Yourself)"**
5. **Remove or relocate "Previous R&D Credit" checkbox**
6. **Add industry benchmarks: "Typical for your industry: $XX,XXX"**

### **PSYCHOLOGICAL OPTIMIZATION:**

- Make entering expenses feel like "finding money" not "doing taxes"
- Use encouraging language: "Great! These expenses qualify"
- Show credit growing in real-time if possible
- Industry comparisons: "Similar businesses claim $XX,XXX"

The form structure is solid - it just needs clearer labeling, better helper text, and the educational content moved out of the primary flow. The goal is to make expense entry feel quick and rewarding, not like a tax form.
