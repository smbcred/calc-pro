Looking at your current Step 1, here are specific recommendations to optimize it:

## **Specific Step 1 Improvements**

### **1. REMOVE THE FLOW DIAGRAM**
The 4-step diagram at top is taking up valuable space and adds confusion. Replace with:
- Simple text: "Step 1 of 4 ‚Ä¢ 2 minutes to complete"
- Or a slim progress bar showing 25% complete

### **2. STRENGTHEN THE HEADER**
Current: "Answer questions about your AI use"
Better: "Let's Check Your R&D Qualification"

Current subtext: "We'll calculate your credit amount and prepare your documentation package. Complete forms ready for filing - hand to your CPA or file yourself."
Better: "Takes 2 minutes to see if you qualify for $15,000-$75,000 in tax credits"

### **3. TIGHTEN THE QUALIFICATION SECTION**

**Section header:**
Current: "Do You Qualify? (Quick Check)"
Better: "Check all activities your business does:"

**Remove the blue explanation box entirely** - it's educational content that belongs on the landing page

**Improve checkbox copy spacing** - some lines are wrapping awkwardly:
- "We use ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI tools to improve our work" ‚úì (good as is)
- "We've built custom GPTs or chatbots" ‚úì (good as is)
- "We've developed prompt templates or libraries" ‚úì (good as is)
- "We've automated tasks with Zapier, Make, or code" ‚úì (good as is)
- "We test and improve our AI prompts or workflows" ‚úì (good as is)
- Current: "We've made our processes 10%+ better with tech"
  Better: "We've improved processes 10%+ with technology"

### **4. CLEAN UP FORM FIELD HEADERS**
Remove emojis from all field labels:
- üìã What's your business name? ‚Üí "Company Name"
- üè≠ What industry are you in? ‚Üí "Industry"
- üí∞ What's your annual revenue? ‚Üí "Annual Revenue"

### **5. IMPROVE HELPER TEXT**
Business name: 
Current: "This helps us personalize your tax credit package"
Better: "As shown on tax returns"

Industry dropdown:
Add below: "Choose closest match"

Annual revenue:
Current: "This determines your eligibility for special startup benefits"
Better: "Determines your tax benefit type"

### **6. STRENGTHEN THE CTA**
Current: "Continue to Your AI Work ‚Üí"
Better: "Calculate My Credit ‚Üí"

Add below button: "No payment required ‚Ä¢ See results instantly"

### **7. REMOVE BOTTOM CLUTTER**
Remove:
- "Save Progress" link (confusing this early)
- Extra spacing before footer

### **8. VISUAL HIERARCHY IMPROVEMENTS**
- Make the checkbox section stand out more with a light background
- Ensure the CTA button is the most prominent element
- Add more spacing between major sections
- Make selected year button more obvious (darker blue)

### **9. TRUST WITHOUT OVERDOING IT**
Current: Multiple "SSL Secured, GDPR Compliant, IRS Approved" mentions
Better: Keep just one instance in the footer

### **10. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION CHECK**
- Ensure checkboxes are easily tappable (44px minimum height)
- Stack the revenue cards vertically on mobile
- Make sure the form doesn't require excessive scrolling

### **QUICK WINS SUMMARY:**
1. Delete flow diagram
2. Delete blue educational box
3. Remove emojis from headers
4. Change CTA to "Calculate My Credit ‚Üí"
5. Simplify helper text
6. Remove "Save Progress" link

These changes will make the form feel more professional and focused while maintaining the good structure you already have.
