Optimize Step 3 as lead capture for a free credit report based on the ONE year of expenses they entered. Pricing for forms is $500-$1500 (tiered by credit size), with additional years at $297 each.

=== CORRECT CONTEXT ===
- They entered expenses for ONE year only
- Free report shows that single year calculation
- Paid service: $500-$1500 for forms (based on credit amount)
- Additional years: $297 each (they'd need to enter more data)

=== STEP 3 IMPROVEMENTS ===

VALUE PROP CARDS - Focus on their selected year:
- Card 1: "Your [YEAR] Estimate: $13K-$20K"
- Card 2: "Free Credit Analysis"
- Card 3: "Based on Your Actual Expenses"

RANGE SECTION:
- Headline: "Your [YEAR] R&D Tax Credit Estimate"
- Show the range based on their inputs
- Below: "Get your exact calculation and see how to claim it"

EMAIL CAPTURE:
- Headline: "Get Your Free [YEAR] R&D Credit Report"
- Subheading: "See your exact credit amount with detailed breakdown"

What your FREE report includes:
✓ Exact [YEAR] credit calculation
✓ Qualifying expense breakdown
✓ How the credit works for your business
✓ Next steps to claim your credit
✓ Future year savings potential

Email field placeholder: "Enter email for instant report"
Button: "Get My Free Report →"

OPPORTUNITY MESSAGING:
Instead of multi-year analysis, show future potential:
"Based on your [YEAR] activities, you could claim similar credits for:"
- Previous years (2022-2023) - if applicable
- Future years as you continue using AI

"Most businesses claim 2-3 years of credits"

REMOVE:
- Multi-year analysis promises (they only gave one year of data)
- Specific pricing mentions (save for Step 4)
- IRS forms references

SET UP THE UPSELL:
After email capture: 
"Next: See your exact [YEAR] credit and learn about claiming previous years"

TRUST ELEMENTS:
- "Free report, no payment required"
- "Based on your actual business data"
- "Takes 30 seconds"

PSYCHOLOGICAL FLOW:
- Step 3: "Here's your [YEAR] estimate range"
- Step 4: "Here's your exact amount + you could also claim [other years]"

This leads perfectly into Step 4 where you:
1. Show exact amount for entered year
2. Upsell previous years ($297 each)
3. Sell the form package ($500-$1500 based on total)

=== KEY FIXES ===
- Single year focus (the year they entered)
- No false multi-year promises
- Future/past year potential (not analysis)
- Correct pricing tiers referenced
- Clear free vs paid distinction
