Example for different credit amounts:
- $8,000 credit → "$500 investment"
- $37,538 credit → "$750 investment"
- $75,000 credit → "$1,000 investment"
- $125,000 credit → "$1,500 investment"

=== WHAT TO REMOVE ===
- Any mention of guarantees
- Audit defense language
- Money-back promises
- Fake phone numbers

=== TRUST BUILDING WITHOUT GUARANTEES ===
Instead of guarantees, use:
- "IRS-compliant methodology"
- "Based on Section 41 regulations"
- "Professional documentation"
- "500+ successful filings"
- Actual success metrics

=== DYNAMIC ELEMENTS ===
