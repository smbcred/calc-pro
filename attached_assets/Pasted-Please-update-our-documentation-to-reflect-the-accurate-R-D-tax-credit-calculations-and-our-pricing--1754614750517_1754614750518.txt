markdown# R&D Tax Credit Calculator Logic

## Overview

The calculator guides users through determining eligibility and estimating their potential R&D tax credit using the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) method, which is most common for small businesses and startups.

## Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Eligibility Check
- Business type (C-Corp, S-Corp, LLC, etc.)
- Use of AI/automation tools
- Technical experimentation activities
- U.S.-based operations

### Step 2: Qualifying Activities
User selects from common R&D activities:
- Software development
- Process automation
- AI/ML implementation
- Product development
- Manufacturing improvements
- Technical problem-solving

### Step 3: Expense Collection

#### Qualified Research Expenses (QREs)

**Wages**
- Number of employees doing R&D
- Average salary
- Percentage of time on R&D (0-100%)
- Formula: `Qualified Wages = Employees × Avg Salary × R&D %`

**Contractors**
- Total contractor costs
- R&D percentage (typically 65% max per IRS rules)
- Formula: `Qualified Contractors = Contractor Costs × R&D % × 0.65`

**Supplies & Cloud Computing**
- Cloud computing costs (AWS, Azure, etc.)
- Software licenses for development
- Development tools and testing materials
- Formula: `Qualified Supplies = Supply Costs × R&D %`

### Step 4: Credit Calculation

**Total Qualified Research Expenses (QRE)**
QRE = Qualified Wages + Qualified Contractors + Qualified Supplies

**Federal Credit Calculation (ASC Method)**

For startups with no prior R&D history:
Federal Credit = QRE × 6%

For companies with R&D history:
Federal Credit = (Current Year QRE - (50% × Prior 3-Year Average QRE)) × 14%

**Important Notes:**
- Most startups use the 6% rate (no prior R&D)
- The credit cannot exceed actual tax liability (unless using payroll tax offset)
- Qualified Small Businesses can offset up to $500,000 in payroll taxes

### Step 5: Pricing Tier Determination

Based on calculated federal credit amount:

| Credit Amount | Service Price | Value Proposition |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| < $10,000 | $500 | Entry tier for smaller credits |
| $10,000 - $50,000 | $750 | Most common tier |
| $50,000 - $100,000 | $1,000 | Significant R&D investment |
| > $100,000 | $1,500 | Enterprise-level R&D |

**Multi-Year Pricing:**
- Base year: Full price (as above)
- Additional years: $297 each
- Maximum: 3 additional years (current year + 3 prior)
- Example: $50,000 credit = $750 base + $297/year for additional years

## Implementation Example

```typescript
interface CalculatorInputs {
  wages: number;
  wageRdPercent: number;
  contractors: number;
  contractorRdPercent: number;
  supplies: number;
  suppliesRdPercent: number;
  hasPriorRd: boolean;
  priorYearAverage?: number;
}

const calculateRdCredit = (inputs: CalculatorInputs) => {
  // Calculate QREs
  const qualifiedWages = inputs.wages * (inputs.wageRdPercent / 100);
  const qualifiedContractors = inputs.contractors * (inputs.contractorRdPercent / 100) * 0.65;
  const qualifiedSupplies = inputs.supplies * (inputs.suppliesRdPercent / 100);
  
  const totalQRE = qualifiedWages + qualifiedContractors + qualifiedSupplies;
  
  // Calculate federal credit
  let federalCredit: number;
  if (!inputs.hasPriorRd) {
    // Startup rate: 6% of current QRE
    federalCredit = totalQRE * 0.06;
  } else {
    // Established company: 14% of excess over 50% of prior average
    const excess = totalQRE - (0.5 * (inputs.priorYearAverage || 0));
    federalCredit = Math.max(0, excess * 0.14);
  }
  
  // Determine pricing tier
  let basePrice: number;
  if (federalCredit < 10000) {
    basePrice = 500;
  } else if (federalCredit < 50000) {
    basePrice = 750;
  } else if (federalCredit < 100000) {
    basePrice = 1000;
  } else {
    basePrice = 1500;
  }
  
  return {
    totalQRE,
    federalCredit,
    basePrice,
    additionalYearPrice: 297
  };
};
