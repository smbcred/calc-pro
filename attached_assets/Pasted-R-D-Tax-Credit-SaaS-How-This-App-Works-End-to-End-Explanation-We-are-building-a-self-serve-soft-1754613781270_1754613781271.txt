R&D Tax Credit SaaS — How This App Works (End-to-End Explanation)

We are building a self-serve software product that helps small businesses in the U.S. claim the R&D tax credit using AI and automation.

Most small business owners don’t know this credit exists — so we guide them from curiosity → education → credit estimate → payment → document delivery.

Here’s how the full flow works:

⸻

👥 USER JOURNEY (Marketing to Delivery)

1. Marketing + Lead Capture
	•	We drive traffic to a marketing landing page (hosted in this same app).
	•	The page includes a “Estimate Your R&D Tax Credit” calculator.
	•	Calculator walks the user through:
	1.	Business type and AI/tool use
	2.	Qualifying activities
	3.	Estimated expenses (wages, contractors, etc.)
	•	At the end of the calculator:
	•	They enter their email
	•	The app estimates their federal refund (e.g. $18,600)
	•	It displays a dynamic price tier (e.g. “Tier 2 – $750”)
	•	It offers multi-year add-ons (e.g. 2023 + 2024) — pricing updates in real time.
	•	CTA: “Get Your Credit Documents”

⸻

2. Checkout
	•	On clicking the CTA, user goes to Stripe Checkout:
	•	Pre-selected tier and tax years
	•	Email captured again by Stripe
	•	After successful payment:
	•	They are redirected to a “Success” page
	•	From there, they can log in to access their secure dashboard

⸻

3. Dashboard + Intake Form
	•	Inside the app dashboard, the user sees a checklist UI of required steps/documents.
	•	First step: Fill out the secure intake form, which captures:
	•	Business details
	•	Total expenses
	•	Qualifying activities
	•	State info
	•	When they submit the form:
	•	All data is saved to Airtable
	•	The app marks that step as “✅ Complete”

⸻

4. Automated Document Creation (via Make.com)
	•	After form submission, the backend workflow kicks in:
	1.	Make.com pulls the customer’s intake data from Airtable
	2.	Sends it to Claude AI, which generates:
	•	Technical Narrative (IRS requirement)
	•	Compliance Memo
	3.	Sends the full data to Documint, which generates:
	•	IRS Form 6765
	•	Section 174A deduction summary
	•	Recordkeeping checklist
	•	Optional: State forms like PA REV-545A
	•	Filing instructions

⸻

5. File Storage + Delivery
	•	All final documents are:
	•	Uploaded to Amazon S3
	•	URLs are saved in Airtable under that customer’s record
	•	A completion email is sent via SendGrid, with:
	•	Download links
	•	Summary of what’s inside
