Global Messaging Updates
Throughout the calculator, use these consistent messages:

"July 2026 deadline for previous years"
"Amend 2022-2024 returns before July 2026"
"Time-sensitive: July 2026 amendment deadline"

Remove or replace:

Generic "expires soon" language
"3-year expiration" references without context
Overly complex deadline explanations

Keep It Simple

Don't explain amendment process details
Don't discuss why July 2026 specifically
Focus on the deadline and the opportunity
Use "July 2026" consistently (not "07/31/26" or other formats)

This creates clear, consistent deadline messaging that drives urgency without overwhelming users with tax complexity.
