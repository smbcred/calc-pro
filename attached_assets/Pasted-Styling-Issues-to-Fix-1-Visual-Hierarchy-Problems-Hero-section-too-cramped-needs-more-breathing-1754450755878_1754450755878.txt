Styling Issues to Fix:
1. Visual Hierarchy Problems

Hero section too cramped - needs more breathing room between elements
Font sizes inconsistent - "$500,000" claim should be much larger
Trust indicators competing - they're all the same visual weight

2. Color & Contrast Issues

Blue banner at top - too similar to primary CTA buttons, creates confusion
Green is overwhelming - too many green elements competing for attention
Input fields too subtle - gray on white is hard to see, needs stronger borders

3. Mobile Responsiveness

Progress indicators cut off - "Step 3 of 4" needs better mobile layout
State coverage stats cramped - numbers overlapping on smaller screens
Bottom buttons too close - "BACK" and "SEE MY SAVINGS" need more spacing

4. Component Styling Fixes Needed
Trust Bar:

Add subtle background (gray-50)
Increase icon sizes
Add dividers between items
Make "2,847+ Successfully Filed" pop more

Value Props:

Use cards instead of plain text
Add subtle shadows
Increase emoji size
Better spacing on mobile

Input Fields:

Stronger border (gray-300 instead of gray-200)
Larger text (text-base instead of text-sm)
Better focus states (ring-2 ring-blue-500)
Info icons need better alignment

Progress Steps:

Make active step more prominent
Add connecting lines between steps
Better mobile collapse (show just numbers)

CTAs:

Primary button needs more padding (py-4 px-8)
Add subtle shadow for depth
Hover state should be more dramatic
"CONTINUE" button too generic - needs arrow â†’

5. Specific Quick Wins

Add container max-width - Content is too wide on desktop
Increase vertical spacing - Everything feels squished (use space-y-8)
Fix percentage slider - Thumb is too small, track needs better contrast
Qualified wages display - Make the calculated amount more prominent
Remove ALL CAPS - Use sentence case for better readability
Add subtle backgrounds - White on white is too flat
Icon consistency - Mix of styles (some filled, some outline)
Loading states - Need skeletons or spinners during calculation

6. Polish Details

Round more corners (rounded-lg everywhere)
Add subtle animations (scale on hover, smooth transitions)
Fix alignment issues (some text not vertically centered)
Consistent padding (some sections have px-4, others px-6)
Better error states for form validation
