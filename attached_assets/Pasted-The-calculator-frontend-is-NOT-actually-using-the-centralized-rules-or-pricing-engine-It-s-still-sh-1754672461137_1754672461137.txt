The calculator frontend is NOT actually using the centralized rules or pricing engine. It's still showing hardcoded 6.5% and the calculations are broken (showing $0). Fix this immediately:

## 1. CHECK THE CALCULATOR COMPONENT

Look for where the federal rate is being calculated. It should be using:
- calculateFederalRate() from the rules engine
- NOT a hardcoded 0.065 or 6.5%

## 2. FIX THE BUSINESS PROFILE DETECTION

The calculator needs to ask for:
- Years in business
- If they had revenue 3+ years ago

Based on the screenshot showing "Under $1M revenue", they should qualify for either:
- 14% startup rate (if < 5 years old and no revenue 3 years ago)
- 10% small business rate (if < 5 years old)
- NOT 6.5%!

## 3. FIX THE $0 CALCULATION BUG

The results screen shows all $0 values. Check:
- Is the QRE being calculated correctly?
- Is the federal credit calculation working?
- Is the data being passed between steps?

## 4. IMPLEMENT THE PRICING ENGINE

For a $10,400 credit, it should show:
- Tier: Growth ($10K-$50K)
- Price: $750
- NOT $500

## 5. UPDATE THE DISPLAY

The Credit Estimate step should show:
- Which rate they qualified for (Startup 14%, Small Business 10%, or Standard 6.5%)
- WHY they got that rate
- Clear pricing based on the tier

## SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

1. In the calculator component, find where it says:
```javascript
const federalRate = 0.065; // WRONG!
Replace with:
javascriptimport { calculateFederalRate } from '@/shared/taxRules/rdTaxRules';

const businessProfile = {
  yearsInBusiness: formData.yearsInBusiness,
  annualRevenue: parseRevenue(formData.revenue),
  hadRevenueThreeYearsAgo: formData.hadRevenueThreeYearsAgo
};

const federalRateInfo = calculateFederalRate(businessProfile);
const federalRate = federalRateInfo.rate; // Will be 0.14, 0.10, or 0.065

Add questions in Step 2 (Business Info):


How many years has your business been operating? [0-50]
Did your business have revenue 3 or more years ago? [Yes/No]


Fix the calculation that's showing $0
Use the pricing engine for the service fee

The calculator is still using old hardcoded logic instead of the new centralized rules!

This is a critical bug - customers seeing 6.5% when they qualify for 14% is leaving money on the table, and the $0 display makes the calculator look broken!
